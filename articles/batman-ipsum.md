# Batman ipsum

Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated. But we are initiated aren't we, Bruce? Members of the League of Shadows. And you betrayed us.

You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals. Didn't you think there might be casualties? Things always get worse before they get better.

I'm here to ensure the League of Shadow fulfills its duty to restore balance to civilization. You yourself fought the decadence of Gotham for years with all your strength, all your resources, all your moral authority. And the only victory you achieved was a lie. Now, you understand? Gotham is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.

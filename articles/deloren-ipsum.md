That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair? Uh, Doc. Nothing. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. Where were we.

Holy shit. Is she pretty? I, I don't know. Oh. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay.

Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? George. I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. Doc. Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa?

Are you gonna order something, kid? Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage? Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date. He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. Who is that guy.

You wouldn't want that to happen would you? Would you? It's my dad. Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong? I, I don't know.

C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history. I think we need a rematch. Ohh, no.
